Exluding properties from getting checked.

  Exclusion of either whole properties files or specific property keys is
  controlled by the two optional mojo parameters fileExcludeRegexp and
  keyMatchRegexp. Parameter fileExcludeRegexp specifies a regular expression
  which a properties file name needs to match in order to be excluded from any
  checks. Parameter keyMatchRegexp specifies a regular expression which a
  property key must match in order to its corresponding property value to be
  checked.

  To exclude all properties files whose name end with "Test" and additionally
  only check property values whose key start with "message" one would need to
  add the following configuration to the mojo:

+---
...
<configuration>
  <fileExcludeRegexp>.*Test</fileExcludeRegexp>
  <keyMatchRegexp>message.*</keyMatchRegexp>
</configuration>
