    System input and output utility components.
    <p>
      This package provides general purpose I/O utility components.
      The {@link org.jdtaus.core.io.util.MemoryFileOperations} class can be used
      as a {@code FileOperations} implementation performing I/O in memory
      without actually performing any real system I/O at all. It is best used
      for small amounts of data which can be obtained as an array of bytes
      easily.
      The {@link org.jdtaus.core.io.util.RandomAccessFileOperations} class can
      be used as a {@code FileOperations} implementation performing real system
      I/O backed by a {@code RandomAccessFile}.
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing I/O intensive applications cacheing may become a concern.
      This package provides two general purpose cache implementations for use
      with {@code FileOperations} implementations. The
      {@link org.jdtaus.core.io.util.ReadAheadFileOperations} cache
      implementation may reduce I/O when reading most of the time. The
      {@link org.jdtaus.core.io.util.CoalescingFileOperations} cache
      implementation may reduce I/O when writing most of the time. In rare
      circumstances a combination of the two implementations may also reduce
      I/O. Cacheing should be used with caution. It may not be the correct way
      to solve a problem which could be solved elsewhere in a more efficient
      way. If performance degradation is encountered with an application caused
      by too much I/O operations, the following considerations should be taken
      into account, <i>before</i> using any of the provided cache
      implementations. First of all, try to reduce the number of I/O operations
      by carefully reviewing your application. Collect some profiling results at
      this point. Only if you see no way in decreasing the number of I/O
      operations performed by the application, consider using one of the
      provided cache implementations. Use the
      {@link org.jdtaus.core.io.util.ReadAheadFileOperations} implementation if
      reading most of the time and the
      {@link org.jdtaus.core.io.util.CoalescingFileOperations} implementation if
      writing most of the time to reduce I/O gaining more throughput. Make sure
      to always measure the results and compare with what you collected without
      cacheing. Note that hardware has a huge impact on the effect
      of applying cacheing. Both cache implementations will reduce I/O usage by
      increasing CPU usage. A system with, for example, a fast harddisk but slow
      CPU may not benefit from applying a cache. The situation may even get
      worse.
